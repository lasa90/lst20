{\an8}NETFLIX PRESENTS

4
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:09,800
It's here.

5
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:26,760
It's concrete, Lino.

6
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:31,880
You think you'll go through with a Clio?

7
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:41,600
What? No, no...

8
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,160
Whose fault is it if we're here?

9
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:45,520
There must be another way to get 10,000.

10
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:48,680
We go through this window,
take everything we can and get out.

11
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:50,800
I'll find another way to get their money.

12
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:52,360
I need weight in the front.

13
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:00,200
Your car won't hold, Lino.

14
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,080
Seatbelt.

15
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:29,320
Shit.

16
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,200
Shit.

17
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,040
Fuck, it's stuck!

18
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:02,960
I can't.

19
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:03,880
Get lost.

20
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:05,680
Get lost!

21
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,080
Lino, move!

22
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:13,040
Come on! Fuck!

23
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:18,640
Fuck.

24
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:35,960
I've got it!

25
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:38,080
Come on, let's go!

26
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:42,640
Come on, throw it!

27
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,080
Behind! Moron!

28
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:47,800
Turn! Come here. Yeah!

29
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:49,840
I'm glad you're here.

30
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,000
Don't start.

31
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,400
Which one is it?

32
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,400
That one.

33
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,320
Let go of me!

34
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,440
Come on!

35
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,360
That guy...

36
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:59,280
You, get lost.

37
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,800
...went through four layers of concrete.

38
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:02,720
Look! Get out!

39
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,600
He did it with a Clio.
He barely twisted his wrist.

40
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,520
I don't care.

41
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:11,640
You want to stop that trafficking,
then leave him to me.

42
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:15,720
The judge agreed.

43
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:18,680
Come on!

44
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,880
You can't get a guy who's not in jail?

45
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:26,800
No.

46
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:31,000
I need a magician. And that's what he is.

47
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:33,640
Trust me.

48
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:39,160
Okay, you have one month. No more.

49
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,800
Bring me two chairs, please?

50
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,480
I lead a team of anti-go fast.

51
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,080
-I don't do go fast.
-I know.

52
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:15,880
-Look.
-That's not me.

53
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:16,800
I know.

54
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:19,480
Take it.

55
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,160
My cars are not up to the task.

56
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:26,920
Zero power.

57
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,920
Zero durability.

58
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,040
Zero chance.

59
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,680
What's your car?

60
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:39,120
A Renault 21, 2 L Turbo. Don't laugh!

61
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:42,520
It's the first interception car
used by the force.

62
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:45,600
I know. My father had one.

63
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:52,400
What do you want? A good tow truck driver?

64
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,840
No, I'd rather a good mechanic.

65
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:57,400
With no plans
for the next couple of years.

66
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,600
What does that mean?

67
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:01,960
I'm done watching my teams
get crushed like hedgehogs.

68
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:05,040
I want to stop these fucking dealers.

69
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:06,800
I have the best pilots.

70
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,120
You'll give them the best cars.

71
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,200
Are you serious?

72
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:11,920
Don't get shot tonight.

73
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,600
I'm picking you up at 7. Sharp.

74
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:55,400
{\an8}NATIONAL POLICE

75
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:58,240
<i>Grey BMW, Adolph, Romeo, Sierra, 7-6-2,</i>
<i>on the run.</i>

76
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,760
<i>We're chasing it, guys!</i>

77
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,720
Interception 10-2. Eyes on the BMW.

78
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,560
Go fast confirmed.

79
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:20,000
<i>Roger that.</i>

80
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:25,880
<i>I'm on it.</i>

81
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:28,520
Forget about it, Areski. Julia is on it.

82
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:35,720
That's good.

83
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:37,000
Stop it.

84
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:47,080
Don't let him go. Get him, now.

85
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:09,120
No, no!

86
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:50,960
Block the traffic.

87
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:07,760
So who's the boss?

88
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,000
We were on it, damn it.

89
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,640
Heading to Paris?

90
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:14,760
Hey.

91
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,360
That's a beauty.

92
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,240
Show me.

93
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,160
Holy fuck.

94
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:52,120
Jeff! You called for the 300's spoiler?

95
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:53,880
Jeff!

96
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,840
-What?
-The spoiler?

97
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,320
I've been waiting for months.

98
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,960
It will get there on the 21st.

99
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,000
Or we have to order--

100
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:15,120
Julia.

101
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:20,440
What are you doing?

102
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:21,760
Nothing, I was in the way.

103
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:24,760
That's right.
So you go back under your car.

104
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,640
-Charas.
-What?

105
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:30,960
Can I stay here tonight?

106
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,000
Again?

107
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:35,760
Okay, I'll call the prison.

108
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:38,280
But tomorrow morning,
you go back to your cell.

109
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:40,640
-So?
-We crushed them.

110
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,520
-How much?
-Frontal, 85.

111
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:45,240
-Peak speed?
-One hundred and fifty.

112
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:47,080
I can optimize the mass transfer.

113
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:49,840
You're a pain with your stuff.
You'll get us killed.

114
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,160
Jeff, let's put it on the bridge.

115
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,480
We'll go celebrate. You join us?

116
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,360
No.

117
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,480
Relax, Julia will get there.

118
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,120
I'm not worried about Julia.

119
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:14,040
What's your deal?
I just risked my life for you.

120
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,640
In six months, not one go fast beat us.

121
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:19,040
You know it's a lie.

122
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:24,080
For each go fast we get,
how many pounds do we miss, 400, 600?

123
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,400
They sacrifice entire loads.

124
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:30,040
They feed us, and we eat.

125
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:35,240
I'm sure they have intel on us.

126
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,840
Who are you talking about? Who's "they"?

127
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,200
I'll know soon.

128
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,960
You overestimate the opponent.

129
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,080
You won that war, Charas.

130
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,880
And it's a little thanks to me.

131
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:03,160
If you change your mind, join us.

132
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,360
Can I talk to you?

133
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:38,280
No.

134
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,280
Jeff, you join us for a drink?

135
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:50,800
See you Monday, Lino.

136
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:05,080
You have to stop that!

137
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:07,160
Come on, get in.

138
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:18,800
All I say is that you have a vintage car
and you won't let me take a look.

139
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:21,880
Nobody touches my 2 L Turbo.

140
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:23,080
-Look at it.
-I'm a pro

141
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:25,840
when it comes to mechanics, all right?

142
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:26,760
Just one--

143
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:30,640
I said no. Never. So stop, now.

144
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:33,240
Then go faster.

145
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,440
If I'm not in my cell by 8,

146
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:37,360
-they'll be on my case.
-Relax.

147
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:38,960
I make the rules.

148
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,680
Today, we'll stray a bit.

149
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:15,880
You like it?

150
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:31,720
Welcome to our future garage, Lino.

151
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,680
You should see your face.

152
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:40,520
Wait.

153
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
The best is that.

154
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:58,880
That's a joke?

155
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,240
Starting next week.

156
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:04,600
Moss validated that?

157
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:07,280
In person.

158
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:11,520
Don't mess with me, Charas.

159
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:15,400
Don't get excited. It's an early release
but there's some conditions.

160
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:17,760
And you deserve it.

161
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,720
This is also thanks to you.

162
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,080
You should tell the others.

163
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:28,680
An inmate in the team,
it didn't look good, is that it?

164
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:31,960
You've been working for nine months
without even a thanks.

165
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:34,320
I believe in second chances.

166
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:40,000
You put too much trust in people,
but don't change a thing.

167
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:42,440
Oh, here...

168
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:48,680
Speaking of trust...
I found that in yesterday's go fast.

169
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:53,320
Can you tell me more about that?

170
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:56,880
-It's an injection diverter.
-Yeah.

171
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,840
Your engine gets 300 percent power

172
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:01,280
but it only lasts 650 feet
before it explodes.

173
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:04,680
Last time I saw that, it was on a Clio
that ended up in a jewelry store.

174
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:06,960
It's exactly the same.

175
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:08,560
And?

176
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:11,280
You were not alone that night.

177
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:13,680
Don't ask me that, Charas.

178
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:15,280
He's my baby brother.

179
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:17,360
I'm not after him.

180
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,600
I'm sure he's working for the guys I want.

181
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:23,000
Quentin is not a brain,
he just attracts shit.

182
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:25,960
How long before your Quentin
ends up behind the wheels

183
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:28,200
of a car that finishes
in Areski's radiator?

184
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,440
Give me your word.

185
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:34,600
You have it.

186
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:47,040
-You're sure he's here?
-No.

187
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:51,120
-We're waiting for Areski.
-He doesn't answer.

188
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,360
I give you two minutes.

189
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,960
Fuck, Areski. Answer your phone.

190
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:22,720
I'm with Lino. It could go wrong.
Call me back.

191
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,600
Fuck that shit.

192
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,120
Surprise!

193
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:54,640
You're into maps?

194
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,480
Stop that shit, you need to move, bro.

195
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:58,640
First, you give me a hug...

196
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,640
Lino, give me your number. I'll call you.

197
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:04,120
Hey.

198
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,480
Looking for something?

199
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,320
I came to see my brother.

200
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,560
Your brother is busy.
Come back another time.

201
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:20,000
You can't let him go
for a couple of hours?

202
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:21,920
We'll get a drink. I'll bring him back.

203
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,520
You told him to come here?

204
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,480
Not at all. Lino, you've got to go.

205
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:29,600
That's fine, Quentin.
We said we'd hang out, let's do it.

206
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:31,720
Kad, get him out of here.

207
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:37,840
What's going on? Hey!

208
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:43,480
Lino!

209
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:47,160
Amazing the amount of shit
you can get into in two minutes.

210
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:48,640
Search him.

211
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:50,840
Fuck.

212
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:57,240
I know that beautiful face. Show me...

213
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:59,000
What's your name?

214
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:06,440
Lino, go get the car.

215
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,520
Marco. Marco!

216
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,280
Cuff these two.

217
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:12,440
We'll make them talk.

218
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:16,520
You brief me?

219
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,320
I'll take care of him.

220
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:21,400
-No, I've got him.
-See you at the warehouse.

221
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:22,760
I said I've got him.

222
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:33,080
-Don't let him take the kid.
-Shut up.

223
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:38,640
Get in.

224
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:46,040
We're in deep shit.

225
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:47,120
"We're in deep shit."

226
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,280
Come on, drive!

227
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:49,920
Drive!

228
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:51,600
Charas!

229
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:06,000
Lino, move! Move, they'll kill you.

230
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,760
They'll fucking kill you. Get lost!

231
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:20,680
Get out.

232
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:07,280
Fuck!

233
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:12,240
Fuck!

234
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:19,440
Kad, Jacques! You burn it,
you disassemble it. I want it gone!

235
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,400
A phone. I need a phone.

236
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:45,680
Hey! Don't move!

237
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:48,480
Put the phone down!

238
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:51,720
Julia, pick up.

239
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:55,120
Drop the phone.

240
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:56,280
Pick up.

241
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:57,440
Drop it!

242
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:58,680
Fuck.

243
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:01,080
Give it.

244
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:02,080
Pick up.

245
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:04,760
Search him.

246
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:07,120
He's clean.

247
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:08,120
You're Charas' mechanic.

248
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:12,880
You're not in jail on weekends?

249
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:19,760
Charas, Bruno here.

250
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:22,960
They brought me your mechanic.
He was armed. Call me back.

251
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,240
Hey.

252
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:29,200
Can you call Julia, please?

253
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:31,840
She's part of the team.
I'll only talk to her.

254
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:33,680
Okay.

255
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:56,600
You thought they'd call Julia?

256
00:25:58,040 --> 00:25:58,880
Sit down.

257
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:01,320
You mind?

258
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:08,280
Nobody will come, Lino. Sit down.
It's just me.

259
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:28,880
You were in the car.

260
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:31,960
Armed men showed up.

261
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:35,360
You noticed a guy from the junkyard.

262
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:36,880
He opened fire.

263
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:39,920
Charas got hit. You couldn't do a thing.

264
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:42,920
You took his gun and ran to save your ass.

265
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:45,280
What do you say?

266
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:47,640
Not bad?

267
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:51,480
Lino...

268
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:55,840
I'm trying to save your ass, okay?

269
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:58,600
I do this for you.

270
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:02,960
So?

271
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:10,640
Up to you.

272
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:18,880
In about 30 min,
they'll find Charas and his car.

273
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:21,600
We caught you with his gun.

274
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:23,800
His blood is on you.

275
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,200
And that...

276
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:30,600
<i>Fuck, Areski. Pick up your phone.</i>

277
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:32,800
<i>I'm with Lino. It could go wrong.</i>

278
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:34,440
<i>Call me back.</i>

279
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:39,280
What's that look?

280
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:41,600
I've been nice to you.

281
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:46,120
It's too bad.

282
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:49,280
Really.

283
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:53,920
You come with me.

284
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:57,240
Cop killer.

285
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,040
You got Charas?

286
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:17,120
Nothing yet.

287
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,040
Fuck.

288
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,040
Bruno, I need your help.

289
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:22,520
-If they know my mechanic got busted...
-Okay.

290
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:27,560
Let me do the paperwork.
He's yours in an hour.

291
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:29,000
One hour?

292
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:30,120
I can't do better.

293
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:32,480
Okay.

294
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:34,200
Nobody gets near him.

295
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:35,240
I'll make sure of it.

296
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:36,560
I'll owe you one.

297
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:39,280
Let's go.

298
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:01,640
Every time...

299
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:03,840
Every time, right?

300
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:46,320
Areski locked the door?

301
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:02,640
Move!

302
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:06,120
Get him!

303
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:07,880
Hold him!

304
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,160
Get him!

305
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:38,680
Asshole!

306
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:41,560
Calm down!

307
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:08,080
Fill up this form...

308
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:10,240
Sign here.

309
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:15,200
-One minute...
-Motherfuckers!

310
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:16,400
Fucking assholes!

311
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:22,880
Come here, hurry!

312
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:27,120
Fucking assholes!

313
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,040
Get out!

314
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:33,160
What's happening?

315
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:34,080
François?

316
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:36,560
Fuck them up, these fucking cops!

317
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:13,200
Go ahead, fuck him up!

318
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:14,680
That fucking asshole!

319
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:16,200
Watch out, behind you!

320
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:19,840
Go ahead, yeah.

321
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:26,520
Let go!

322
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:29,520
Get up!

323
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:31,280
Come on!

324
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:34,240
-Let go!
-Get up!

325
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:40,520
Hold him here!

326
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:43,560
Cuff him!

327
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:47,000
Come on!

328
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:55,240
They lost contact by the river banks.

329
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:00,720
They shot him like a dog.

330
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:04,600
He wouldn't get played like that.

331
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:07,040
Not him.

332
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:09,400
Lino fooled us all, Moss.

333
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:11,320
Meanwhile he disappeared.

334
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:16,400
Ten cops, not one could stop him.
Where were you?

335
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:23,040
I'm ready to fix this.

336
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:26,080
Put me in charge.

337
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:29,480
Charas wouldn't have wanted that,
you know it.

338
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:48,080
It's gonna be okay.

339
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:15,200
You're insane! What are you doing?

340
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:18,120
Now you look like you lost a colleague.

341
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:22,240
Step up. That shit slows you down.

342
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:23,880
-What about Moss?
-I'll handle her.

343
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:25,320
Like you did with Charas.

344
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:29,000
Fucking shit! Are you kidding me?

345
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:33,280
I've got the balls to protect us both.
That's how you thank me?

346
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:35,600
Never say that again, okay?

347
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,520
I won't let Moss fuck this up.
The brigade is ours.

348
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:46,840
We'll be able to clear double the load.
Without Charas, it's open bar.

349
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:49,080
You're going too far.
If Lino gets caught...

350
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:52,040
We'll be the first to know.
You know the guys.

351
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:55,920
If he talks, nobody will believe him.
He's burned.

352
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:57,880
I'm not serene.

353
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,360
Why didn't Jacques burn Charas
with his car?

354
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:03,720
Everything burned.
There is no fucking proof!

355
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:06,080
Stop being a pussy, shit!

356
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:17,680
We'll take care of Jacques,
Kad and the kid.

357
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:20,880
I need you, Marco, okay? Get a grip!

358
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:24,840
I need you, Marco.

359
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:27,320
Come on.

360
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:33,440
Let's go.

361
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:37,120
Julia!

362
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:39,000
Hey!

363
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:51,240
Julia!

364
00:38:57,560 --> 00:38:58,520
I just want to talk.

365
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:01,720
-Julia!
-I was framed by Areski.

366
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:03,920
Hey!

367
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,080
He killed Charas.

368
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:09,000
I can't turn myself in, I have no proof.

369
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:12,240
Okay.

370
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:23,200
You have to believe me.

371
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:34,040
Fuck!

372
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:36,480
Julia!

373
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:15,880
Lino, uncuff me.

374
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:22,840
You're making it worst.

375
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:26,320
Charas!

376
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:29,440
That's not the right rims.

377
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:30,920
That's not his car.

378
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:40,920
That's not Charas' car.

379
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:43,480
Lino, uncuff me!

380
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:49,680
Lino!

381
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:15,040
What happened?

382
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:17,040
I don't fucking know, I was locked up!

383
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:19,960
-I don't--
-Your story does not make sense.

384
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:22,160
-I can't--
-You don't listen!

385
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:25,360
You're not hurt?

386
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:26,880
That's fine. I got this.

387
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:28,240
Moss, she's my colleague.

388
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:31,480
Let her breathe, she'll answer you after.

389
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:38,760
He threatened you?

390
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:41,520
No, it was weird.

391
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:45,360
He did not make sense.
He accused you and Marco.

392
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,880
He's trying to brainwash you.

393
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:53,200
He was hoping you'd help him run.

394
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:55,280
-I'd never do that.
-I know, gorgeous.

395
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:57,960
When they come after you, I'll be there.

396
00:41:58,600 --> 00:41:59,520
Who's gonna come?

397
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:01,840
Moss...

398
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:03,680
Colleagues outside.

399
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:06,680
If they find out about you and Lino...

400
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:11,080
It's all good, relax.

401
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:14,360
We won't say a thing, okay?

402
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:16,560
It wasn't serious between us.

403
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:20,040
I know.

404
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:22,640
-Take your time.
-Yeah.

405
00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:13,280
Quentin, don't forget that.

406
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:43,680
So we cover it?

407
00:44:44,120 --> 00:44:46,120
-Bring it.
-Here.

408
00:44:58,240 --> 00:44:59,080
What the fuck?

409
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:00,680
The cars are impounded?

410
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:02,440
You don't need it to track down Lino.

411
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:06,720
I'll stay for a while, it's such a mess.

412
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:10,480
It's not necessary.
The team is operational.

413
00:45:10,840 --> 00:45:11,800
There's no more team.

414
00:45:14,360 --> 00:45:15,680
Don't take away the brigade.

415
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:18,560
Let go.

416
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:24,920
Why are you calling me?

417
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:32,880
-Don't make me pay for Charas' mistakes.
-You think I'm here to punish you?

418
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:37,640
Get that brigade out of your head
and focus on the mechanic.

419
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:45,280
I'll bring him back.

420
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:47,360
Be easy on Julia.

421
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:50,360
Don't make her pay
for her liaison with Lino.

422
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:51,720
Have a good day.

423
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:00,600
You fucked up, guys.

424
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:01,840
Really?

425
00:46:03,120 --> 00:46:04,920
I know you didn't burn Charas' car.

426
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:11,440
Areski's bullet is still inside.

427
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:20,640
I'm done.

428
00:46:57,880 --> 00:46:59,080
They're gonna kill him.

429
00:46:59,160 --> 00:47:01,800
Forget about him.
He's not our problem. Drive.

430
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,560
-Let's get the money and the drug.
-That's not the plan.

431
00:47:53,640 --> 00:47:55,000
It will take a minute.

432
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:56,120
No!

433
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:57,880
I won't turn myself in.

434
00:47:57,960 --> 00:47:59,400
You're not, I hand you over.

435
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:01,360
I save your life, and that's it?

436
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:04,600
I didn't come for you.
I didn't need a thing.

437
00:48:06,040 --> 00:48:07,600
I'm not made for jail.

438
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:09,960
I took two years for you.

439
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:13,200
You got out after three weeks.

440
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:17,520
Where do you think I slept?
And when I was out, I worked for the cops.

441
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:22,040
Truth is, you never felt better.
When the cop died, I bet you cried.

442
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:28,120
That cop died because of you.

443
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:30,760
Never talk about him again, okay?

444
00:48:31,880 --> 00:48:32,760
Sorry.

445
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:39,120
I'm freaking out.

446
00:48:47,080 --> 00:48:48,720
-I have an idea.
-No need.

447
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:50,080
-Listen!
-No need!

448
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:51,440
Fucking listen!

449
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:54,840
I heard you talk about the car earlier,
with Areski's bullet...

450
00:48:55,080 --> 00:48:56,200
You know where it is?

451
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:57,560
Yes, I hid it.

452
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:03,040
Jacques has another hideout.
Areski doesn't know it.

453
00:49:03,600 --> 00:49:04,920
You're just stalling.

454
00:49:07,640 --> 00:49:09,760
Even if I know where it is,
how do I bring it?

455
00:49:10,560 --> 00:49:12,960
I can't take the chance
to run into Areski or Marco.

456
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:21,320
Not really what I expected.

457
00:49:38,040 --> 00:49:39,200
Let's stay calm.

458
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:44,560
Listen to me before you make a mistake.

459
00:49:56,240 --> 00:49:57,640
You think you're in charge?

460
00:50:21,800 --> 00:50:23,800
Sorry, I'm out of bullets.

461
00:50:24,520 --> 00:50:25,520
Wait!

462
00:50:27,360 --> 00:50:28,520
The car was not my idea.

463
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:31,000
Let me go. I'll tell you where it is.

464
00:50:31,240 --> 00:50:33,560
Which car? What are you talking about?

465
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:35,200
The cop's car.

466
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:38,480
Jacques did not burn it.

467
00:50:39,840 --> 00:50:41,240
He asked the kid to hide it.

468
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:48,000
I can take you there.

469
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:50,920
It's in a barn nearby.

470
00:50:54,600 --> 00:50:55,640
I'm listening.

471
00:51:02,520 --> 00:51:03,360
Julia.

472
00:51:14,560 --> 00:51:15,560
I did what you said.

473
00:51:16,040 --> 00:51:19,360
Given the frame and the steering,
it hasn't run for years.

474
00:51:24,560 --> 00:51:27,480
Lino was right. That's not Charas' car.

475
00:51:34,520 --> 00:51:36,720
-Moss, we need to talk.
-I don't have time!

476
00:51:37,120 --> 00:51:38,640
Lino just made two more victims.

477
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:40,000
Are you sure it's him?

478
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:42,960
I'll pretend I didn't hear that.

479
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:44,720
That's not what you think, Moss.

480
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:46,360
Jeff just told me that--

481
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:49,360
I really like you, Julia.
But Areski told me about you and Lino.

482
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:51,880
So you stay put until we find him,
is that clear?

483
00:52:16,920 --> 00:52:17,920
You took your time.

484
00:52:19,080 --> 00:52:20,080
He had a tough skull.

485
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:21,080
What are you doing?

486
00:52:22,080 --> 00:52:23,320
I'll get rid of the riffle.

487
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:24,280
You're in a rush?

488
00:52:26,920 --> 00:52:27,760
No.

489
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:30,560
Get rid of it when we're done with Moss.

490
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:40,320
He said something?

491
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:45,520
No more witnesses, no more worries.

492
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:47,360
Two more and it's over, Marco.

493
00:52:48,920 --> 00:52:50,000
I'm a witness too.

494
00:52:52,320 --> 00:52:53,360
I know what I'm doing.

495
00:53:30,200 --> 00:53:31,360
Find us a quiet spot.

496
00:53:34,360 --> 00:53:35,240
Julia, it's Lino.

497
00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:38,680
<i>Hello?</i>

498
00:53:40,680 --> 00:53:42,680
Give me a good reason
not to hang up on you.

499
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:44,840
<i>I didn't kill Charas, you know it.</i>

500
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,160
The two corpses at the junkyard,
it's not you?

501
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:51,800
<i>They were alive when I left them.</i>
<i>Areski and Marco found them, I bet.</i>

502
00:53:53,680 --> 00:53:55,520
<i>Remember where Charas introduced us?</i>

503
00:53:55,600 --> 00:53:58,680
They think I'm your fucking accomplice!
Why am I even talking to you?

504
00:53:58,840 --> 00:54:02,520
Take your car and meet me
where we first met.

505
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:03,880
Alone.

506
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:05,560
<i>What are you thinking, Lino--</i>

507
00:56:05,600 --> 00:56:06,560
Go ahead.

508
00:56:09,360 --> 00:56:11,040
I'm Quentin, 19. Abandoned at birth,

509
00:56:11,120 --> 00:56:15,040
I spent my childhood in foster homes,
where I met Lino. He taught me everything.

510
00:56:15,120 --> 00:56:17,880
It's my fault if he's been to jail
and if he goes back.

511
00:56:18,280 --> 00:56:21,920
I was working in a junkyard to pay back
guys I owed money to. Jacques and--

512
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:23,080
Move on, they're dead.

513
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:25,400
I was preparing cars for go fast.

514
00:56:25,880 --> 00:56:27,880
Lino arrived this morning
with the other cop.

515
00:56:27,960 --> 00:56:29,240
Charas.

516
00:56:29,600 --> 00:56:32,480
He wanted to take me in
but another cop showed up and shot him.

517
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:35,000
Areski.

518
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,760
I'd seen him at the junkyard
but I didn't know he was a cop.

519
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:42,360
Anyway, I've witnessed it all.

520
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:54,080
Here's how I see things...

521
00:56:55,840 --> 00:56:59,960
You take us in, Areski shoots us before
Quentin testifies. You carry that guilt.

522
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:04,120
Or you leave with us and we'll come back
together with proof.

523
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:07,320
What do you say?

524
00:57:13,720 --> 00:57:14,680
You have to be crazy.

525
00:57:18,360 --> 00:57:19,360
Who are these guys?

526
00:57:19,840 --> 00:57:21,200
Go fast organizers.

527
00:57:22,560 --> 00:57:23,800
Lino's old friends.

528
00:57:45,560 --> 00:57:46,400
Fuck.

529
00:57:47,120 --> 00:57:49,840
You go to the farm
and you find me that fucking car.

530
00:58:28,640 --> 00:58:29,840
-Moss!
-What?

531
00:58:31,680 --> 00:58:33,040
My guys apprehended Julia.

532
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:36,400
She helped Lino escape
in front of witnesses.

533
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:39,120
Get in.

534
00:58:40,640 --> 00:58:41,560
I have my car.

535
00:58:42,520 --> 00:58:43,480
Don't worry.

536
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:46,680
I'll wait for forensics,
I'll bring you your car.

537
00:58:46,760 --> 00:58:47,800
Areski!

538
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:49,840
Coming.

539
00:59:34,560 --> 00:59:37,080
He told me they were dead.
No one's here. Don't worry.

540
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:40,240
I'm the only one who knows this place.

541
00:59:46,280 --> 00:59:47,640
I'll try to find the key.

542
00:59:47,720 --> 00:59:48,800
No, wait.

543
01:00:02,600 --> 01:00:04,600
Of course. All right...

544
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:08,880
Quentin!

545
01:00:15,560 --> 01:00:16,480
Quentin!

546
01:00:33,040 --> 01:00:34,600
That's why you brought me here?

547
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:36,840
Dude, look at all this dough.

548
01:00:36,920 --> 01:00:39,120
What don't you understand? I need the car!

549
01:00:39,720 --> 01:00:42,240
Fuck! We can buy 10,000 cars with this!

550
01:00:46,800 --> 01:00:47,720
Hey!

551
01:00:49,720 --> 01:00:50,640
Quentin.

552
01:00:53,840 --> 01:00:54,680
Hey.

553
01:01:08,920 --> 01:01:09,760
Lino!

554
01:01:12,240 --> 01:01:13,960
I'm just here for the car!

555
01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:15,800
Tell me where it is.

556
01:01:22,520 --> 01:01:23,520
Come help the kid!

557
01:01:33,080 --> 01:01:34,280
Suit yourself.

558
01:03:56,040 --> 01:03:59,200
Tell me where he is!
I'm talking to you. Tell me where he is!

559
01:04:00,680 --> 01:04:01,600
Stop it.

560
01:04:02,560 --> 01:04:03,440
Go get some air.

561
01:07:58,520 --> 01:08:00,880
<i>I've got it, Julia. Fuck, I've got it.</i>

562
01:08:02,840 --> 01:08:03,680
Julia?

563
01:08:04,080 --> 01:08:06,520
<i>Julia won't be able to answer</i>
<i>for quite a while.</i>

564
01:08:08,760 --> 01:08:10,840
Call me directly next time,
it will be faster.

565
01:08:11,560 --> 01:08:12,600
<i>She knows everything.</i>

566
01:08:13,120 --> 01:08:14,920
No one will believe her. You're alone.

567
01:08:16,680 --> 01:08:19,800
I ran into Marco,
we talked about you a bit.

568
01:08:20,400 --> 01:08:22,240
<i>The conversation didn't end well.</i>

569
01:08:22,760 --> 01:08:23,960
<i>You're alone, too, now.</i>

570
01:08:25,120 --> 01:08:26,200
Don't worry about that.

571
01:08:27,560 --> 01:08:28,960
You'll see my new pilots soon.

572
01:08:29,040 --> 01:08:31,680
Charas gone, the brigade is mine.
You're a dead man, Lino.

573
01:08:31,800 --> 01:08:33,280
Funny, you mention Charas.

574
01:08:33,440 --> 01:08:35,400
He left you a souvenir. Want to know what?

575
01:08:35,480 --> 01:08:36,600
Yes, go ahead.

576
01:08:36,880 --> 01:08:37,720
<i>A clue.</i>

577
01:08:38,200 --> 01:08:39,280
It's a car.

578
01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:40,760
<i>-Yeah.</i>
-Red.

579
01:08:40,840 --> 01:08:42,760
<i>With your gun's bullet inside.</i>

580
01:08:44,280 --> 01:08:46,400
You're talking shit.
I got it burned, asshole.

581
01:08:46,840 --> 01:08:48,080
Jacques kept the real one.

582
01:08:48,560 --> 01:08:49,640
<i>Marco didn't tell you?</i>

583
01:08:50,160 --> 01:08:51,240
You don't have the car.

584
01:08:58,120 --> 01:08:59,000
<i>Sound familiar?</i>

585
01:09:00,080 --> 01:09:03,080
Listen to me, you son of a bitch.
We'll find you--

586
01:09:03,160 --> 01:09:05,280
Don't waste gas. I'll bring it over.

587
01:09:05,360 --> 01:09:06,440
<i>Moss will be happy.</i>

588
01:09:06,800 --> 01:09:10,240
You'll never reach the warehouse!
You won't drive 300 feet before I know it.

589
01:09:11,640 --> 01:09:12,880
<i>Listen to me, little shit.</i>

590
01:09:14,200 --> 01:09:19,160
I'll give you one more chance. Run away
from this car if you care about your life.

591
01:09:19,240 --> 01:09:22,400
Charas left me a chance
and I won't let him down, son of a bitch.

592
01:09:35,680 --> 01:09:38,640
The first to catch Lino
gets a spot in the brigade.

593
01:10:21,440 --> 01:10:23,440
<i>I know Charas meant a lot to you.</i>

594
01:10:24,240 --> 01:10:25,800
You're still in shock.

595
01:10:27,440 --> 01:10:28,600
It can help you.

596
01:10:29,920 --> 01:10:31,800
We all make mistakes, under pressure.

597
01:10:32,880 --> 01:10:35,560
Charas had big plans for you
and if he was still around--

598
01:10:35,640 --> 01:10:37,760
If he was still around
he'd be on Lino's side.

599
01:10:40,360 --> 01:10:43,040
<i>You prefer throwing away your career,</i>
<i>your life, for a guy</i>

600
01:10:43,120 --> 01:10:45,480
<i>who could have come clean 20 times</i>
<i>but rather hide?</i>

601
01:10:45,960 --> 01:10:46,880
Sorry, my friend.

602
01:10:48,960 --> 01:10:50,600
<i>He should be here, not you.</i>

603
01:10:50,680 --> 01:10:52,360
<i>He's too busy doing your job.</i>

604
01:10:59,440 --> 01:11:01,240
You have the night to think it through.

605
01:11:01,400 --> 01:11:04,360
Then Internal Affairs will take over,
I won't be able to help you.

606
01:11:04,440 --> 01:11:06,320
And me help you.

607
01:11:06,400 --> 01:11:09,960
When Lino gets back with the car,
you won't be able to say you didn't know.

608
01:11:57,120 --> 01:11:58,240
For sure he'll drive by?

609
01:11:58,600 --> 01:12:01,640
Don't worry, he'll come.
Bring me all the cars!

610
01:12:32,120 --> 01:12:33,080
It's for a movie.

611
01:12:52,440 --> 01:12:53,960
<i>He was located at a gas station.</i>

612
01:12:55,080 --> 01:12:55,920
Say that again.

613
01:12:56,560 --> 01:13:00,600
<i>He was located at a gas station.</i>
<i>He's on the D60, coming your way.</i>

614
01:13:00,680 --> 01:13:02,240
Renault 21 confirmed?

615
01:13:02,320 --> 01:13:04,080
<i>Confirmed. Over.</i>

616
01:13:04,160 --> 01:13:07,480
You stick to him so he can't turn around.
Tell me when you see him.

617
01:13:07,560 --> 01:13:08,400
<i>Roger that.</i>

618
01:13:08,840 --> 01:13:10,080
We close the road block.

619
01:13:44,080 --> 01:13:47,240
Okay, 21 confirmed.
He spotted us. We'll pressure him. Over.

620
01:13:47,920 --> 01:13:48,920
Go ahead. You're on.

621
01:14:09,440 --> 01:14:10,440
Come on!

622
01:14:18,960 --> 01:14:20,440
Where is he? I can't see him!

623
01:14:26,560 --> 01:14:27,400
Behind.

624
01:14:36,360 --> 01:14:37,400
Don't slow down!

625
01:14:43,480 --> 01:14:45,160
Stay away from his hooks!

626
01:15:14,320 --> 01:15:15,480
Fucking asshole!

627
01:15:15,560 --> 01:15:16,680
We're down!

628
01:15:27,960 --> 01:15:29,000
Stop, Lino!

629
01:15:29,720 --> 01:15:31,040
Stop!

630
01:16:09,280 --> 01:16:11,000
<i>He's pushing us! Fuck!</i>

631
01:16:11,080 --> 01:16:12,720
Stop shouting, I can't hear a thing.

632
01:16:12,840 --> 01:16:14,600
<i>Fuck! Stop it! He's pushing us!</i>

633
01:16:14,720 --> 01:16:16,640
Stop shouting, I can't hear anything!

634
01:16:16,720 --> 01:16:18,400
<i>Fuck! Don't shoot!</i>

635
01:16:26,560 --> 01:16:28,040
<i>Don't shoot!</i>

636
01:16:43,640 --> 01:16:45,840
Shoot. Fucking shoot!

637
01:16:45,920 --> 01:16:47,440
Go ahead, morons!

638
01:16:48,640 --> 01:16:49,760
Fucking shoot!

639
01:18:15,640 --> 01:18:16,520
Yes, Moss.

640
01:18:21,520 --> 01:18:22,800
Which car was it?

641
01:18:24,960 --> 01:18:26,120
Yes, where?

642
01:18:26,200 --> 01:18:27,320
<i>A Renault 21, red.</i>

643
01:18:27,400 --> 01:18:29,240
<i>He authorized the road block.</i>

644
01:18:29,320 --> 01:18:31,000
<i>We have two casualties, hurry up!</i>

645
01:18:31,080 --> 01:18:33,760
<i>A Renault 21... We're sending two cars.</i>

646
01:18:33,840 --> 01:18:36,080
I don't care that your cars crashed.
Catch Areski.

647
01:18:36,160 --> 01:18:37,680
<i>Going toward the D60.</i>

648
01:18:38,120 --> 01:18:40,440
Areski, pick up. Areski...

649
01:18:41,040 --> 01:18:44,400
I order you to stop the pursuit.
Cars are on the way. If you touch Lino...

650
01:18:45,160 --> 01:18:46,520
No, Julia!

651
01:18:47,760 --> 01:18:48,640
Julia!

652
01:19:18,200 --> 01:19:19,080
Watch out!

653
01:19:37,080 --> 01:19:39,920
I'm near the river banks.
Make sure Areski doesn't get to Lino.

654
01:19:45,160 --> 01:19:46,240
Fuck!

655
01:19:52,840 --> 01:19:54,000
Oh, fuck.

656
01:21:36,640 --> 01:21:38,760
Hey... Julia.

657
01:23:04,280 --> 01:23:05,600
Areski!

658
01:23:13,040 --> 01:23:14,720
Find me anything!

659
01:23:14,800 --> 01:23:17,040
I don't give a fuck, do you hear me?

660
01:23:17,640 --> 01:23:21,680
I need anything, a taxi, an ambulance,
I don't care!

661
01:23:21,760 --> 01:23:23,520
A scooter, who cares?

662
01:23:25,120 --> 01:23:27,240
Move your ass!

663
01:23:27,680 --> 01:23:29,200
I don't know where they are!

664
01:23:39,520 --> 01:23:40,520
Fuck.

665
01:23:49,600 --> 01:23:50,560
Moss!

666
01:25:55,080 --> 01:25:57,360
He's downstairs.
You don't want to give it to him?

667
01:25:57,600 --> 01:25:58,440
No.

668
01:26:01,560 --> 01:26:02,480
Julia...

669
01:26:04,600 --> 01:26:05,800
Tell him to stick around.

670
01:26:06,760 --> 01:26:08,160
In case we need him.
